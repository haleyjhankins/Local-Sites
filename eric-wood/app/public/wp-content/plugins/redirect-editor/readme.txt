Protect your WordPress website automatically without any interaction by you! wp-config is automatically protected, as is license.txt, readme.html, and your wp-content/uploads. We also help remove certain services logged out users could abuse to try and remotely break into your site without visiting your site directly. These also pose other issues from time to time. We also provide features you can use including a 301 redirect editor, that's very easy to use!  

== Description ==

We hide wordpress from scanners the best we can for free. We make it so you don't have to mess with code and block hackers from finding you by using hacker tricks. We do that for free. 
We protect your wordpress security by blocking access to install.php, wp-config.php & readme.html. We hide the plugin directory and theme directory from malicious bots trying to find them to hack your wordpress site. Again, all those features are free.  
We  Hide wordpress  version that is in wp_generator, so scanners looking for people who haven't updated yet are more likely not to find you, if you hadn't removed it. Yet another awesome free feature.
We also provide free features, like the redirect editor, so you can easily get 301 redirects like you get with editing your .htaccess, but instead all you do is put in the name of the link and we do the rest for you without touching your htaccess! 

Our free WordPress security for your website is amazing.  We removed Windows Live writer, RSD and other unneeded services for logged out users, as they can be used to remotely try and login, ddos attacks and can cost you money to your web host! We only allow these features to exist when you are logged in and actually need them. If you are logged in as a contributor or higher all of those features are available to you.
More features soon! 


Our premium version includes a state of the art scanner for known ways hackers are exploiting WordPress plugins. This is a lot like an anti-virus in many regards. We make sure you are safe and if you aren't, we tell you what's wrong.
Premium is awesome and a must have for any serious site.

Our redirect feature lets you redirect your posts, pages and more with ease and simplicity to make redirects for your website. Redirect editor is a great replacement to complicated plugins for managing redirects on your website. The redirect editor simply allows you to add a textarea to edit and manage your 301 redirect, one per line. 

Enter each redirect as follows. Use   the absolute URL of the 
destination to redirect to, separated by a space. Each redirect must 
be on its own line. You can put comments by using #. 


Below is an example of how to enter redirects in the redirect editor. As you can see each redirect has a new line and in our example there are two redirects.

    /2012/09/old-post/ http://www.example.com/2012/09/new-post/
 /2012/10/new-post/ http://www.example.com/2012/10/newer-post/
 
 All WordPress security is automatically applied.

After installing, go to Settings > Redirect Editor to configure.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file, drop the contents in your wp-content/plugins/ directory, and then activate from the Plugins page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How secure is this plugin? =

This plugin has been adopted by Planet Zuda, a security company that has updated all of the security and   usability  of this plugin passing testing to show it is a secure plugin. To prove our WordPress security and feature plugin is secure we ran it through an exclusive invite-only bug bounty with only one small flaw found and fixed. Planet Zuda will be responsible for any  and all future updates.

= Does it support wildcard/regular expression matching? =

No, just simple string matching for the time being.

= Does it add in any features besides redirect? =
Yes, it protects wp-config, readme.html and license.txt from attackers. Logged out users can not use  windows live writer, really simply discovery among other services. If you are logged in as contributor or higher you may use the third party services. 
== Screenshots ==

1. Redirect editor is easy to use, you just type in the page you want redirected as shown in the example and then put the link to where we are redirecting to. It is the simplest redirect tool for seo and gives an accurate 301 response for WP. The other features help secure your site and currently happen in the background without any interaction, besides activating the plugin.
